Awesome list of open-source startups challenging big closed-sourced brothers. Maintained by folks at [Runa Capital](https://runacap.com/). 

Also checkout the [ROSS index](https://runacap.com/ross-index/): the fastest-growing open-source startups, every quarter.

Here we add only open source projects that satisfy two criteria:
1. Project must be commercial (it has paid offering or explicitly states willingnes to add paid features in the future)
2. Project must have a closed-sourced competitor (well-known company or product that at least shares a subset of features with the project).

See [Contributing](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
