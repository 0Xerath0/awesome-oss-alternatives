Awesome list of open-source startups which substitute big closed-sourced brothers. We call it the "OSS Clone Wars". Maintained by folks at [Runa Capital](https://runacap.com/). 

Also checkout the [ROSS index](https://runacap.com/ross-index/): fastest-growing open-source startups, every quarter.

Here we add only open-source projects that satisfy the following criteria:
1. Project must be commercial (it has paid offering or explicitly states willingnes to add paid features in the future)
2. Project must have a closed-sourced competitor (well-known company or product that at least shares a subset of features with the project)
3. Project must be a startup (private independent company founded less than 10 years ago and raised less than $100M in total known funding)
